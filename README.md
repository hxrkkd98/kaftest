## KAF - Contract & Vendor Management System

This is a Laravel application that uses Firebase (Firestore & Authentication) without requiring the gRPC PHP extension. The application uses REST API for all Firebase operations.

### Features

- User Authentication with Firebase Auth
- Contract Management
- Vendor Management
- Dashboard with Contract Statistics
- Profile Management

### Firebase Configuration (No gRPC Required)

This project is configured to use Firebase REST API instead of gRPC. See [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

### Quick Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Setup Firebase**
   - Place your Firebase credentials at `storage/app/firebase_credentials.json`
   - Update `.env` with Firebase settings (see FIREBASE_SETUP.md)

4. **Setup Database**
   ```bash
   touch database/database.sqlite
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. **Build Assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

   Or run individually:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   npm run dev
   ```

### Testing Firebase Connection

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Then run:
```php
Firebase::firestore()->database()->collection('users')->documents();
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
